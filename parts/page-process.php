            The first step in our process is to meet with you in-person to discuss your ideas and understand your needs. This is the time to bring your photos, floorplans, Pinterest boards and any other wish list ideas you want to incorporate into your dream home or renovation. We’ll be offering our own ideas as well as addressing any questions or concerns you may have. Let’s take this opportunity to get to know each other, discuss pricing, and determine if we’re the right for you!
